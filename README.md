![Levelfly logo](public/images/levelfly_tag.png?raw=true)

Levelfly is an open-source, achievement-based Learning Management System (LMS) and social network, developed by [Neuronic Games][neuronic] for [Borough of Manhattan Community College][bmcc] and [City University of New York][cuny] with funding from the [National Science Foundation][nsf] and the [U.S. Department of Education][us-doe].

A demonstration instance of Levelfly is available at https://levelfly-staging.herokuapp.com

## Working on Levelfly

These instructions have been tested on Linux & OSX. Please [edit this file][editreadme] if you can add set-up instructions for any other platform, or for tools like Docker or Vagrant.

1. Install [Postgres][postgres], and Ruby 2.4.10 ([RVM][rvm] is recommended)
2. Check out the Levelfly code:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/neuronic-games/levelfly.git && cd levelfly
    ```
3. Create a Postgres database:
   ```
   createdb -U postgres levelfly
   ```
4. Edit `config/database.yml` to set your database username and password
5. Initialise the database:
    ```
    bundle exec rake db:create
    bundle exec rake db:migrate
    bundle exec rake db:seed
    ```
6. Set up S3 storage â€“ either sign up for [AWS][aws-s3] or set up [minio][minio]. Then, edit `config/application.yml` to pop in your S3 API key
7. Install [MailCatcher][mailcatcher] to display outgoing mail in a browser instead of sending it:
    ```
    gem install mailcatcher
    mailcatcher
    ```
8. Run the server and job workers:
    ```
    bundle exec jobs:work &
    rails s
    ```
